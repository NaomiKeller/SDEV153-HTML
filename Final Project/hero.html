				<h2>Introduction to Hero</h2>
					<figure>
						<img src="images/heroreq.png" alt="Hero Requirements">

					<h4>What is Hero?</h4>
					<p>Hero is an interesting class. It is a hybrid of all class categories: ranged, tech, and striking. It was released 
					in Episode 5 as a new type of compound class. Phantom is releasing in Episode 6 and will be similar 
					to Hero in the same way.  You unlock
					Hero by leveling a class in each category of damage to 75.
					There are three titles you must receive in doing so. 
					You can see the unlock requirements to the right from bumped.org.</p>
					<h4>How do you play Hero?</h4>
					<p>Hero's photon arts are not the same ones linked to weapons in every other class. Rather, Hero has it's own
					unique PAs for each weapon it can equip: Sword, Talis, and Twin Machinegun (TMG). Most people choose a weapon of the three and
					stick to it. This is mostly because it's harder to affix or build to multiple types of damage. Much like the Hunter guide,
					I will be sticking to Sword for this guide, as it is the one I have the most experience with.</p>
					<p>Hero's unique Photon Arts have a lot of complexity compared to other classes. Interestingly though, the Sword's normal attack is the main
					source of damage for the Hero. It has a wide cone of effect, and deals the most DPS of the options. JA normal attacking into a stationary boss or a group of mobs
					is the most optimal use of the normal attack. All of the PAs serve a unique purpose and have a use though.
					I will go through each Sword PA in detail then at the end I will explain the Weapon Action and Step mechanics for Hero sword.</p>
					<h4>Brightness End</h4>
					<p>This is a wide AOE slash. If you have enough PP, you can charge it to deal a massive one hit of damage. The biggest advantage to this PA
					is how many i-frames it give you. During the charging process, you do not take damage. This is useful if you see an attack coming and want a quick
					parry type attack to stay in the action.</p>
					<h4>Flash Trick</h4>
					<p>This is your movement ability. Not really used for damage, but it gets you around quicker than anything in the game aside for maybe the Katana's Asagiri.</p>
					<h4>Rising Slash</h4>
					<p>If tapped, you and your sword rise up dealing moderate damage. The main advantage of this is gaining height. If held down, you slash repeatedly.
					Once you let go, a final slam attack is released. If you cancel your slam attack with a normal attack, you retain your height however. The DPS for this PA
					is not better than the Sword's normal attack, but you can move while you hold it down. This means if a boss is on the move it's better to use this over normal attack.</p>
					<h4>Vapor Bullet</h4>
					<p>This is another mobility PA. You can dash in any direction while also dealing ranged damage. This is great if you are trying to relocate or get
					out of the way. </p>
					<h4>Step and Weapon Action</h4>
					<p>Stepping is the main source of i-frames for the Hero. It has a long period of effect relative to other dodges. It takes a while to get the timing just right,
					but once you have it down you can't really get hit. After successfully dodging an attack with Hero step, you can normal attack after for a huge amount of damage.
					The Hero Sword weapon action is a stationary ranged attack, where you shoot bullets from your hand. This regenerates PP. It doesn't deal a lot of damage, but can
					be useful if you run out PP in a dicey situation. It can be held down to charge for different stages of damage. Also, if you time the weapon action in a JA after a normal attack, it charges it instantly, which can add some nice combo
					damage if the enemy is mobile.</p>

				<h2>Skill Tree</h2>
					<p>The Hero skill tree is incredibly straight-forward when compared to the flexibility of other classes. Hero also
					does not get a subclass option. This lack of flexibility may make it seem like Hero may not be as powerful,
					but it is without a doubt one of the strongest classes in the game. The lack of customization is a turn off for
					some player however. For the skill tree, you pretty much want to max everything important out, and then use
					any extra SP you have left to add into more damage, defense, or utility. 
					</p><p><a target=_blank href="https://arks-layer.com/skillsim/skillcalc.php?17cnbMIobMIobMIobMIobMIobMIobMIobMIobMIobMIo0jdodBdo00jqndBdBIb00000006dodA00fdAdBIo000000jdoIbIb00dAdBIo000000jdoIb00dBdBIb000000dB006dBdBIb0000008dBIn00jdndBdB0000009bIoIo07bfdBdB000000doIbIo00dBdBIb000000jdB00dndBdB000006dBqBeKdBrBJ2qoIoqnjdAqB00000f">
					You can see which skills to max out here.</a> I put one SP into "TMG Attack PP Save" because even if you run with
					sword as your main weapon, sometimes you need to whip out your TMG, and just even one SP in that skill makes the
					normal attack on TMG a lot less costly. If you're wanting to main TMG, I would max that out. Also, if you plan to run Talis,
					which I don't think many people do, I'd get the "Talis Charge Keep" skill. That's really it in terms of customization. For
					the rest of your SP, I would suggest going for "H Flash Guard", "All ATK Up", and "Weak Attack Critical".
					</p>
					<p>Hero gets made fun of a lot in the community for being a bit cheese, but it is a lot of fun and very effecive when mastered. It's
					definitely something to work towards if you have the time!
